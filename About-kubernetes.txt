-->A ReplicaSet (rs) is the next-generation ReplicationController. ReplicaSets support both equality- and set-based Selectors, 
    whereas ReplicationControllers only support equality-based Selectors. Currently, this is the only difference.
    
-->Equality-Based Selectors:
      Equality-Based Selectors allow filtering of objects based on label keys and values. With this type of Selectors, 
      we can use the =, ==, or != operators. For example, with env==dev we are selecting the objects where the env label is set to dev. 
   Set-Based Selectors:
      Set-Based Selectors allow filtering of objects based on a set of values. With this type of Selectors, we can use the in, notin, 
      and exist operators. For example, with env in (dev,qa), we are selecting objects where the env label is set to dev or qa.
